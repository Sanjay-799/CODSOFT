Titanic Survival Prediction
##Project Overview
The "Titanic Survival Prediction" project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python's data science libraries to analyze and visualize the dataset, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and survival status. The dataset is typically divided into a training set and a test set, where the training set is used to train the machine learning models, and the test set is used to evaluate their performance.

##How to Run the Notebook

To run the notebook in Google Colab:

*Open Google Colab: Navigate to Google Colab and log in with your Google account.

*Upload Notebook: Upload the notebook.ipynb file to your Google Colab workspace.

*Run the Notebook: With the notebook open, execute each cell by selecting it and pressing Shift + Enter. This will run the code in the cell and proceed to the next one.

##Required Python Packages
The necessary Python packages for this project are:

*pandas
*numpy
*matplotlib
*seaborn
*scikit-learn

NOTE:These packages are pre-installed in Google Colab, so you don't need to install them separately.

##Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's sex
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the notebook, ensure that the dataset is correctly uploaded to your Google Colab workspace and that the necessary packages are imported.

We hope you find this project helpful and informative. HappyÂ analyzing!
